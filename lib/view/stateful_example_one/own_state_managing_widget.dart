/**
 * we're going to create a class that will manage its own state
 * it's the first video on Flutter state mangemnt in detail series
 * let's start and see how it works
 * we need to tell one thing first
 * 
    State is not a widget, although in Flutter everything is widget
    State is an object We'll see that in a minute
    
 * The OwnStateManagingWidgetState class:

    Manages state for OwnStateManagingWidget.
    We'll define the _stateChanged boolean which determines the boxâ€™s current color.
    Next, we'll define the _changeState() function, which updates _stateChanged when the box is tapped and calls the setState() function to update the UI.
    At the end, we'll implement all interactive behavior for the widget.

    Okay, let's start
